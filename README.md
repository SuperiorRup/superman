# superman

**Superman** was built to make it easy to host [Discord Bot Maker](https://dbotmaker.io/) bots on [Glitch](https://glitch.com).

I used [this guide](https://dbotmaker.io/forums/threads/glitch-hosting-free-compatible-with-beta-saves-data.305/), but now all the files are publicly avaliable. I take ownership of updating the actions here often, but I still reccomend making sure the mods that **you** use are here. I am just using the public mod-pack, so if you use that, **you're good to go!**
